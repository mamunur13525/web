# Flow AI Studio — Case Study

## Overview
Flow AI Studio is an AI-powered web app where users can generate **text**, **images**, and **videos** using modular blocks. Each block can connect to another, allowing data to flow between them—for example, a text block can send generated text to an image block, or a video block can pass content to a text block.  
The platform also includes an **AI Chat Block** that works with text, image, and video inputs.

## The Challenge
The main challenges were:
- Integrating AI image and video generation 
- Ensuring different blocks (text, image, video, chat) could connect and share data  
- Handling issues with video-to-text and image-to-text model accuracy  
- Designing a scalable database for future features  
- Adding project collaboration, permissions, and credit-based payments  

---

## Solution
### Block System  
- Built a modular block editor where each block generates content independently.  
- Added support for text → image, image → text, video → text, and many more block combinations.  
- Implemented an AI Chat Block with multimodal support.

## Learnings
This project was challenging and rewarding.  
I improved in:
- AI model integration  
- Complex database design    
- Payment systems and permission roles  
- Building complete documentation  

Overall, Flow AI Studio became one of my best learning and development experiences.
